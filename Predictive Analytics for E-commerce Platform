# Predictive Analytics for E-commerce Platform

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a predictive analytics project aimed at improving product reorder behavior prediction for a leading e-commerce platform. The project involved data cleaning, extensive feature engineering, and the implementation of machine learning models.

## Project Highlights
- Developed and implemented machine learning models to predict product reorder behavior.
- Achieved a significant increase in model accuracy through extensive feature engineering and fine-tuning.
- Handled class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to improve model robustness.
- Collaborated on hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to select the best-performing models.
- Evaluated model performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.

## Data
The project uses the InstaCart Online Grocery Basket Analysis Dataset, including CSV files such as aisles, departments, order_products_prior, order_products_train, orders, and products.

## Key Files
- `predective analytics.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the CSV data files used in the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages and dependencies required to run the code.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the `predictive anlaytics.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to replicate the project.
